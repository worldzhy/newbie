/**
 * Scan the NestJS DI container for providers whose registration name matches
 * any of the given constructor names.
 *
 * Foundation services (PrismaService, ClickhouseService, ...) are registered
 * with their class as the DI token. We cannot import these classes from an
 * npm package — they live in the host's assembled source tree — so instead
 * we iterate the internal container's provider map and match by the
 * InstanceWrapper's `name` getter (which returns token.name for class
 * tokens).
 *
 * This is a single-pass scan: we walk the container once and collect every
 * match, so adding more known indicators does not increase the number of
 * container traversals.
 *
 * Returns an array of { name, instance } pairs for matching services.
